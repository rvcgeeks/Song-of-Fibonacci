# Song-of-Fibonacci
Well have you ever wondered that even simple math can create a beautiful music?!? So this is it then ... this cpp program creates a full scale MIDI orchestra by dynamically calculating the fibonacci sequence...

just compile and run fibonaccimusic.cpp by normal g++ compiler and enjoy!!!

this repo also has the references i had used for coding...
and also a test program "orchestra.cpp" to test the midimake utility...

on Linux you can play .mid audios by any tool like Midimake
